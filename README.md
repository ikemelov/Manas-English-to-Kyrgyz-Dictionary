English to Kyrgyz and Kyrgyz to English Dictionary with C++ and SQLite3

  Kyrgyzstan, officially the Kyrgyz Republic, is a mountainous landlocked country in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan was a former Soviet Union member and gained independence approximately 25 years ago. Due to its close history with the USSR, Kyrgyzstan has two official languages: the Kyrgyz language and the Russian language. To learn English, kids use books and the internet. However, books are very expensive and are produced in a limited capacity, and digital divides persist between rural, urban and suburban Kyrgyzstan. According to UNICEF, more than 80 percent of schools in Kyrgyzstan are in rural areas. Thus, 80 % of kids in KG do not have proper access to the internet and books. My idea for the English and Kyrgyz dictionary aims to solve some of the problems schools in rural areas face.
